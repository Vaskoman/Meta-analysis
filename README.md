# Meta-analysis
Identify novel significant genes and interactions for DO and GO categories
Paper organization:
1. Workflow
2. DO categories with the most associated datasets and names of datasets (tables)
2A. Extract genes associated with each category and look for novel genes that become significant when all datasets are considered.
2B. Focus on bacterial infection category.
2C. Show these novel significant genes in the context of enriched GO-BPs (look at bookmarked GO graphs).
3. GO-BP categories with the most associated datasets and names of datasets (tables)
3A. Extract genes associated with each category and look for novel genes that become significant when all datasets are considered.
4. Graphical view for gene interactions.
